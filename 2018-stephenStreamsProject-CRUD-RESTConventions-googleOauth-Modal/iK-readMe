----------------------------------------
iK-readMe:
----------------------------------------
- this project is created by stephen in his react course back in 2018.
- there are three folders within: api / client / rtmpServer
	- you will need to 'npm install && npm start' for it to run.
- the projects does not work fully, not sure why but the main CRUD mostly work and the structure is what you should pay attention to.
- I wrote down notes quickly so not everything is perfect and you can add along the way if you want to.

----------------------------------------
iK-take aways from this:
----------------------------------------
- skim on the overall project and look at the CRUD / REST conventions / modal part mostly as that is the big takeaway for future references when you do real projects.
	- this will also give you an idea how spa folder layout can look like.
- the project is a live streaming project where you can watch streams, log in to your google account to watch your exclusive stream videos, create streams videos, edit stream video, delete stream videos, etc...
	- You would be using the OBS desktop interface to upload your live streams.
	- many things are not perfect and this is just a simple project to give you an idea what CRUD / REST convention / oAuth looks like. However there is still many issues like security / etc...
- stephen used react / react-router / google oAuth browser library / flv.js / redux / semantic-ui / redux-form / etc...

- use this to give you a good idea of how CRUD and REST convention works.
	- with the use of react-router and redux.
- normally the modal would not have its own react-router path as stephen did here. Usually it would be just a normal imported component that you display with true or false.
	- or you could use a 3rd party library modal instead.

----------------------------------------
/api folder
----------------------------------------
- this is the mock backend database server folder we need for the REST convention.
	- we are using the JSON-Server library.

----------------------------------------
/client folder
----------------------------------------
- this is the main folder for doing all the coding. including CRUD / REST conventions / google oAuth / modal

----------------------------------------
/rtmpserver folder
----------------------------------------
- this folder provides a rtmp server for taking in the OBS live streaming api so we can ajax it.
	- using the Node-Media-Server library to create the rtmp server.
	- the rtmp server is required for live streaming media.
